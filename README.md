PROPOSED MODEL 
Streamlined Body 
         Less drag force on body 
Crescent Shaped Caudal Fin
         Fast movement 
Dorsal fins
         Stability of the fish and prevents the fish from rolling over 

As per the proposed Model of Soft Robotic Fish , a CAD model is made using Creo Software - dwg files if each part has been uploaded along with a dwg file of the whole fish as well

ANALYSIS OF THE CAD MODEL
USING ANSYS WORKBENCH
MODULE: ANSYS FLUENT WORKBENCH 2020 
  -- pre processor stage completed 
  -- Boundary conditions - completed 
  -- solver stage - completed 
  -- post processing stage completed
  
RESULTS OBTAINED AFTER POST PROCESSING STAGE 

   * STRAIN 
   * STRESS 
   * VELCOITY PROFILE OVER MODEL (FLOW ANALYSIS)
